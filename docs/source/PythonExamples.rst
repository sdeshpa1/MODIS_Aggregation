Python Programming Examples
================================
Below are some of the Python Examples for reference:

Python Program to Check if a Number is Positive, Negative or 0
---------------------------------------------------------------

num = float(input("Enter a number: "))
if num >= 0:
   if num == 0:
       print("Zero")
   else:
       print("Positive number")
else:
   print("Negative number")

Output 1:
Enter a number: 2
Positive number

Output 2:
Enter a number: 0
Zero

Python Program to Check if a Number is Odd or Even
----------------------------------------------------

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if (num % 2) == 0:
   print("{0} is Even".format(num))
else:
   print("{0} is Odd".format(num))

Output 1:
Enter a number: 43
43 is Odd

Output 2:
Enter a number: 18
18 is Even

Python Program to Check Prime Number
-------------------------------------
2 x 3 = 6.

Source Code
# Program to check if a number is prime or not

num = 407

# To take input from the user
#num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# prime numbers are greater than 1
if num > 1:
   # check for factors
   for i in range(2,num):
       if (num % i) == 0:
           print(num,"is not a prime number")
           print(i,"times",num//i,"is",num)
           break
   else:
       print(num,"is a prime number")

# if input number is less than
# or equal to 1, it is not prime
else:
   print(num,"is not a prime number")

Output:
407 is not a prime number
11 times 37 is 407

Python Program to Find the Factorial of a Number
---------------------------------------------------

# Python program to find the factorial of a number provided by the user.

# change the value for a different result
num = 7

# To take input from the user
#num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

factorial = 1

# check if the number is negative, positive or zero
if num < 0:
   print("Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
elif num == 0:
   print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
   for i in range(1,num + 1):
       factorial = factorial*i
   print("The factorial of",num,"is",factorial)

Output:
The factorial of 7 is 5040

Python Program to Print the Fibonacci sequence
-----------------------------------------------

# Program to display the Fibonacci sequence up to n-th term

nterms = int(input("How many terms? "))

# first two terms
n1, n2 = 0, 1
count = 0

# check if the number of terms is valid
if nterms <= 0:
   print("Please enter a positive integer")
elif nterms == 1:
   print("Fibonacci sequence upto",nterms,":")
   print(n1)
else:
   print("Fibonacci sequence:")
   while count < nterms:
       print(n1)
       nth = n1 + n2
       # update values
       n1 = n2
       n2 = nth
       count += 1

Output:
How many terms? 7
Fibonacci sequence:
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
